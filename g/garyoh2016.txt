 garyoh2016,     Lol EveningTap,I think Taco Bell's Diablo sauce is definitely one you will want to make sure you have some water close to you beforehand,as my eyes usually water quite a bit after some gets on it :D panicBasket VoteYea,        <Channel name: ibabyrainbow>,       2024-11-07 02:09:36.892745 

 garyoh2016,     I think the fastest I have ever gone in any vehicle that I have owned so far is about 105,which was for one time only on a stretch of Interstate 90 which is within the Mentor to Willoughby area in northeast Ohio,but I only was going that fast because there weren't any cops around during the early weekend morning I did it on in I think July of 1998,and also there weren't any other cars on the road besides mine at the time,and the car I did it in was a purple colored 2002 Dodge Neon :)  VoteYea,        <Channel name: ibabyrainbow>,       2024-11-07 15:25:20.743392 
garyoh2016,     Lol 420_techguy,I think the Appalachian mountains,which run in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania,and into West Virginia as ***e pretty rocky,as I went through those while riding in the back of covered backed pick-up truck a few times heading to a grandma's house that is located in Dilliner,Pennsylvania with my family while still in grade and high school in the late 80's and early 90's,as we traveled there on Interstate 79 in Pennsylvania,which runs through those mountains :) VoteYea,        <Channel name: ibabyrainbow>,       2024-11-07 15:33:52.781923

garyoh2016,     Cool TurtleMashYT,another very beautiful spot to view is when the Aurora Borealis Lights appear over Lake Erie,in varoius spots in northeast Ohio,as they have many times in the past few months,including about I think 10 times or so within the past 3 months where I am in Madison,Ohio :) DxCat VoteYea,        <Channel name: ibabyrainbow>,       2024-11-07 15:53:40.030426 
garyoh2016,     Lol,speaking of snacks of the chip kind,I got a bag of Taki's brand Dragon Sweet Chili rolled tortilla chips a good while,and I have only been able to eat maybe 10 at a time of those at a time,as they are extremely hot too me,but they are still very good as well I think too :) :D panicBasket VoteYea,        <Channel name: ibabyrainbow>,       2024-11-07 16:00:33.117120
