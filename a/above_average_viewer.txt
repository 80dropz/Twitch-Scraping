 above_average_viewer,     @Mr_Chuw, you mean the current thing, or overall Hmm,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:23:17.210504

 above_average_viewer,     @Mr_Chuw, overall the right wing party winning slowly all over, they might get majority in parlament too, and our local guy that is kind of like trump is gaining popular vote too, so he might win elections, but he will win only because there are no other candidates that arent idiots kek,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:24:59.115736 

 above_average_viewer,     and current thing is still developing, everybody playing blame game, government ruling in minority now because coalition fell,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:26:08.424873 

 above_average_viewer,     everybody in opposition is making moves so its hard to tell, nobody expected it so its kind of chaotic now,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:26:37.750099 

 above_average_viewer,     all i see in news is how buch of people making statements and do meetings and how the party that the thrown out minister belonged, all others are either leaving the party or they leaving thier positions now,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:27:51.063252 

 above_average_viewer,     if the leading partys dont agree on anything the election might happen in april-march already,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:28:56.987455 

 above_average_viewer,     so it will be very chaotic and entertaining too because nobody got the program for election ready too, so it will be everybody talking what they will do about mass migration,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:30:06.212652 

 above_average_viewer,     so even normal parties will do right wing talking points, they already do,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:30:36.681920 

 above_average_viewer,     it seem this way, but its hard to tell how it will develop,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:31:32.106428 

 above_average_viewer,     nato also made statemets about it and brussels awell,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:31:58.026198

 above_average_viewer,     but yeah, its a beginning of new century and the germany does the thing again like in the last century monkaLaugh at least it seems kind of similair,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:34:17.325311 

 above_average_viewer,     well we dont have the militarists right now around like there were last time,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:34:37.100857 

 above_average_viewer,     the thing is, some talking points that are actually centrist, are now suddenly "right",        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:36:02.326343

 above_average_viewer,     i dont think it will be this bad, it already happened in netherlands, the guy who was promising to ban islam after elections didnt manage to do it because of the EU laws,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:40:33.554836 

 above_average_viewer,     people turn out any logic for some reason when talking politics,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:41:25.819160 

 above_average_viewer,     yeah, and this is how we got here pepeLost,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:44:26.349780 

 above_average_viewer,     oh boy, there might be now confidence vote or how its called for our chanceler now veryFors,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:50:56.794054

 above_average_viewer,     ICANT the guy that got thrown out is now giving speech how bad the government is (that he was part of) but puts the blame on everybody else,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 11:59:46.969685 

 above_average_viewer,     i hate this guy tbh, and worst part is that i voted for him last elections, because his talking points were making lots of sense, and after he got elected he wasnt doing shit,        <Channel name: robcdee>,       2024-11-07 12:16:30.971962
