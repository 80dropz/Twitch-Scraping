 mrstrexx,     hello do you know how to stop double clicking until now I had auto confirm edit turned off so I was confirming but I feel it would be better to switch to auto confim but I'm a moron and I keep clicking twice,        <Channel name: mongraal>,       2024-11-07 09:37:57.615283 

 mrstrexx,     when you use Windowed Fullscreen don't you have input deelay ?,        <Channel name: mongraal>,       2024-11-07 09:40:02.231820 

 mrstrexx,     Hi Mongraal, could you show your mouse sensitivity settings? I see you have 800 DPI and 100% for both building and editing, but it feels kind of slow for me. Meanwhile, you move like you’re having an epileptic fit!,        <Channel name: mongraal>,       2024-11-07 09:53:53.820390 

 mrstrexx,     @jlibaa  I mean, yeah, but they're built, etc.,        <Channel name: mongraal>,       2024-11-07 09:54:51.394977
