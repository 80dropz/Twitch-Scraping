 frziez,     Case, this is Clark’s dad. I heard by my son you had fired him from tripple C’s, and in a very very rude way. as well he mentioned that he never got his last paycheck so I have contacted the department of unpaid wages and if I need I will file a lawsuit. hope this message reaches you well. and you better re hire my son as he is an amazing worker. thanks,        <Channel name: caseoh_>,       2024-11-07 01:40:28.378206
