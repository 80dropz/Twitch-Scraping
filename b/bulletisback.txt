 bulletisback,     @psuallday I HAVE A 4080 super in my editing PC. MUCH BETTER THAN THE 4070. Have the 4090 in my gaming PC.,        <Channel name: nadeshot>,       2024-11-07 02:49:37.509054

 bulletisback,     @psuallday Zzyea so I would def get the 4080 super over the 4070,        <Channel name: nadeshot>,       2024-11-07 02:51:06.580808 

 bulletisback,     @chiefbotter The 4070 can’t overclock the way a 4080 super can so no it’s pretty different actually,        <Channel name: nadeshot>,       2024-11-07 02:51:55.534223
