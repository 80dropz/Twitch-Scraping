chrispb4con,     @Kickn__NZ Every single thing is player made, from weapons to vehicles, buildings... Base building in itself is hard as well, especially if people just do whatever the fuck they want to. THe gun play is also different from anything I have ever played.,        <Channel name: summit1g>,       2024-11-07 15:55:10.899300

chrispb4con,     @Kickn__NZ The great thing about the game is the community. I learned almost everything from other players. If you see someone doing something you can just run up to them and ask. A lot of people are willing to teach you,        <Channel name: summit1g>,       2024-11-07 15:56:57.306742
