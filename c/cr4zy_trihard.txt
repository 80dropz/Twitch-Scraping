 cr4zy_trihard,     @naydnn, sry but everytime I try to talk politics in a civiliced way with an american it always goes completely bonkers. I get it ur political situatuation is very heated but, however not every verbal argument needs to end in a civil war. I'll leave that to you.... sry for the long text,        <Channel name: pokelawls>,       2024-11-07 09:58:24.976486
